# FarCry1-Respawning-Paraglider-Mod
A mod for FarCry1 to allow for Paragliders to respawn with the onAbandon hook in the editor. (Multiplayer)

Built for GOG.com's release of FarCry1, but should technically work with any FarCry1 release.
You'll just need to point the installer to the root of your FarCry installation manually if your install is not from GOG.

To use mod - connect a Paraglider's `On Abandoned` event to a multiplayer Phoenix. That's it. :)
